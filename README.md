# espn-fantasy-mcp

A local MCP server that reads and writes ESPN fantasy sports (football, basketball, baseball) using **your own ESPN session cookies**. It replaces manually driving a browser pane for ESPN: Claude Code or Codex can call its tools directly. No web UI, no cloud, no server — one Node process talking stdio to your AI client, and HTTPS to ESPN.

It does **not** propose, accept, or reject trades. That's out of scope permanently.

---

## Setup (do this once)

These steps are written to be followed exactly, in order — copy-paste the commands.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer (`node --version`)
- An ESPN account that's a member of the fantasy league you want to control
- Git and (optionally) the GitHub CLI (`gh`) if you're cloning from a private repo

### 2. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> espn-fantasy-mcp
cd espn-fantasy-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

`npm run build` compiles `src/` to `dist/index.js`, which is what your MCP client will actually launch.

### 3. Get your ESPN cookies

ESPN's fantasy API isn't public — it authenticates the same way your browser does, with two cookies. There is no username/password step; you copy these two values once and they last about a month.

1. Log into `https://fantasy.espn.com` in any browser, and open your league.
2. Open DevTools (F12 or right-click → Inspect).
3. Go to **Application** (Chrome/Edge) or **Storage** (Firefox) → **Cookies** → `https://fantasy.espn.com`.
4. Find the cookie named `espn_s2` — copy its whole value (it's long).
5. Find the cookie named `SWID` — copy its value including the curly braces, e.g. `{ABCDEF12-3456-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890}`.

Never paste these into a chat with an AI assistant, an issue, or a commit. They go in one place only: your local `.env` file, which is already listed in `.gitignore`.

### 4. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```
ESPN_S2=<paste the espn_s2 value>
ESPN_SWID=<paste the SWID value, with braces>
ESPN_SPORT=ffl          # ffl = football, fba = basketball, flb = baseball
ESPN_SEASON=2026
ESPN_LEAGUE_ID=<your league id — the number in your league's ESPN URL>
ESPN_TEAM_ID=<your team id in that league>
WRITES_ENABLED=false    # leave false until you've checked dry runs look right
```

Your league id and team id are both visible in the URL when you're looking at your team on fantasy.espn.com (`...leagueId=XXXXXXX...&teamId=N`).

### 5. Sanity-check it runs

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

You should see `espn-fantasy-mcp running (sport=..., season=..., writes disabled (dry run only))` printed to stderr, and the process will sit waiting for stdio input — that's correct for an MCP server. Ctrl+C to stop it. If you see an error about `ESPN_S2 and ESPN_SWID are not set`, go back to step 4.

## Connect it to your AI client

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add espn-fantasy -- node /absolute/path/to/espn-fantasy-mcp/dist/index.js --scope user
```

`--scope user` makes it available in every Claude Code session on this machine, not just the current project. Alternatively, drop this in a project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "espn-fantasy": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/espn-fantasy-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex

Add to Codex's MCP server config (`~/.codex/config.toml` or equivalent):

```toml
[mcp_servers.espn-fantasy]
command = "node"
args = ["/absolute/path/to/espn-fantasy-mcp/dist/index.js"]
```

Restart Claude Code / Codex after adding the server.

## Tools

Every tool takes `sport`, `season`, `league_id` (all default from `.env` if omitted). Write tools also take `team_id`.

### Reads (no confirmation needed, rate-limited to 2/sec, not logged)

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `get_league` | Settings: scoring, roster slots, acquisition/waiver settings, schedule, trade settings, current scoring period |
| `get_teams` | Team ids, names, owners, records, waiver rank |
| `get_rosters` | Every team's roster (or one `team_id`): player id, name, position, pro team, eligible slots, lineup slot, injury status, lock state, projections |
| `get_free_agents` | Free agents / waiver wire, filterable by slot, sorted by ownership or projection |
| `get_matchups` | A scoring period's matchups: totals and live projections |
| `get_boxscore` | A scoring period's per-player actuals |
| `get_transactions` | Executed transactions (adds, drops, trades, draft picks), most recent first, resolved to player names. Paginated (`limit`/`offset`) — a full season's draft alone can be 100+ records |
| `get_pending` | Pending waiver claims and trade proposals (read-only — this server never acts on trades) |
| `get_player` | Look up a player by id or name search |
| `snapshot` | League state in the line-oriented text format used by `frontoffice-manager`'s `tools/diff-snapshot.mjs` |
| `optimal_lineup` | Suggests a starting lineup (fills the most restrictive slots first, then best remaining projection), ranked by season or a specific scoring period. A heuristic suggestion only — apply it yourself via `set_lineup` if you agree with it |

### Writes (rate-limited to 1 per 5 sec, every real send logged to `logs/writes.jsonl`)

Every write tool takes `dry_run` (default `true`). A dry run validates and reports what *would* be sent without sending it. Setting `dry_run: false` only actually executes if `WRITES_ENABLED=true` in `.env` — otherwise it's still treated as a dry run. After a real write, the tool re-reads the affected state and returns it so you can confirm the change landed.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `set_lineup` | Apply a batch of `{player_id, to_slot}` moves. Validates roster membership, slot eligibility, lock state, and the league's slot-count limits before sending anything. |
| `add_free_agent` | Add an unclaimed free agent, optionally dropping another player |
| `waiver_claim` | Submit a waiver claim, optional conditional drop, optional FAAB `bid` |
| `cancel_claim` | Cancel a pending waiver claim by transaction id |
| `move_to_ir` | Move a player to IR/IL (a lineup move to the IR slot) |
| `activate_from_ir` | Move a player out of IR/IL into an active or bench slot |

**Not implemented, ever:** proposing, accepting, or rejecting trades.

## Known limits — read before relying on this

- **This uses an undocumented API.** ESPN can change response shapes or payloads at any time without notice; nothing here is officially supported.
- **Cookies expire**, typically after about a month. When a request that used to work starts returning a clear "refresh your cookies" error, go back to step 3 above. The server never retries a 401 and never prints cookie values, even in error messages or logs.
- **`set_lineup` (and the `move_to_ir` / `activate_from_ir` tools built on it) can execute real writes** — the lineup-move payload was captured live on 2026-09-10 (see **The lineup-move payload** below) and is implemented in `buildLineupBody` in `src/espn/writes.ts`, verified in dry run against a real roster.
- **Rate limits are conservative and process-local** (2 reads/sec, 1 write per 5 sec) — fine for one interactive AI client, not built for concurrent callers.
- **The read/write endpoint split matters**: reads go to `lm-api-reads.fantasy.espn.com`, writes to `lm-api-writes.fantasy.espn.com`. Mixing them up produces confusing errors.

### The lineup-move payload

Captured live on 2026-09-10 from a real bench↔FLEX swap. ESPN's lineup UI sends the move as a `ROSTER` transaction with one `LINEUP` item per player whose slot changed — a two-way swap is two items, each carrying *that player's own* prior slot as `fromLineupSlotId`:

```json
{
  "isLeagueManager": false, "teamId": 5, "type": "ROSTER",
  "memberId": "{SWID}", "scoringPeriodId": 1, "executionType": "EXECUTE",
  "items": [
    {"playerId": 4429023, "type": "LINEUP", "fromLineupSlotId": 20, "toLineupSlotId": 23},
    {"playerId": 4568490, "type": "LINEUP", "fromLineupSlotId": 23, "toLineupSlotId": 20}
  ]
}
```

Implemented in `buildLineupBody` in `src/espn/writes.ts`. If ESPN ever changes this shape, re-capture it the same way:

1. Open a fantasy.espn.com team page in a **logged-in** browser, on your team's roster tab.
2. Open DevTools Console and paste an interceptor, then press Enter. **Note:** ESPN's lineup-move request is sent via `XMLHttpRequest`, not `fetch` — a `fetch`-only interceptor (like the one used for the waiver-claim/cancel-claim payloads) will silently miss it. Wrap both:

   ```js
   (function(){
     const of = window.fetch;
     window.fetch = async function(u,o){ try{ if(String(u).includes('lm-api-writes')){ const a=JSON.parse(sessionStorage.ffcap||'[]'); a.push({kind:'fetch',u:String(u),m:o&&o.method,b:o&&o.body}); sessionStorage.ffcap=JSON.stringify(a);} }catch(e){} return of.apply(this,arguments); };
     const open = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open, send = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send;
     XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function(method,url){ this.__cap_url=url; this.__cap_method=method; return open.apply(this,arguments); };
     XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send = function(body){ try{ if(this.__cap_url && String(this.__cap_url).includes('lm-api-writes')){ const a=JSON.parse(sessionStorage.ffcap||'[]'); a.push({kind:'xhr',u:String(this.__cap_url),m:this.__cap_method,b:body}); sessionStorage.ffcap=JSON.stringify(a);} }catch(e){} return send.apply(this,arguments); };
   })();
   ```

3. Make **one** lineup move in the UI (drag a player, or use Move/Here) and confirm it.
4. Run `sessionStorage.ffcap` in the console and copy the result.
5. **Redact `espn_s2` and `SWID`** from anything captured before sharing or committing it.

## Development

```bash
npm run build   # compile TypeScript
npm test        # run unit tests (lineup validator, snapshot formatter)
npm start        # run the compiled server directly
npm run dev      # run from source with tsx, no build step
```

Project layout: `src/index.ts` (tool registration and output schemas), `src/espn/client.ts` (HTTP, cookies, rate limiting, 401 handling), `src/espn/constants.ts` (slot/team/position tables), `src/espn/reads.ts` / `src/espn/writes.ts` (API calls and payload building), `src/lineup.ts` (local lineup-move validation), `src/optimalLineup.ts` (the `optimal_lineup` suggestion algorithm), `src/snapshot.ts` (the text snapshot format), `test/` (unit tests, no network).

## Credits

The ESPN v3 fantasy API is undocumented; this project leans on prior reverse-engineering work rather than starting from scratch:

- [cwendt94/espn-api](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api) (Python) — the slot/position/pro-team/stat-id constant tables in `src/espn/constants.ts` are ported from here, and the `lineupLocked` roster-entry field used for lock detection was confirmed from its player-parsing code.
- [mkreiser/ESPN-Fantasy-Football-API](https://github.com/mkreiser/ESPN-Fantasy-Football-API) (JavaScript) — read-endpoint client for cross-reference.
- [KBThree13/mcp_espn_ff](https://github.com/KBThree13/mcp_espn_ff) — an existing Python MCP server for ESPN football reads, referenced for tool naming.
- `dylancharris`'s ESPN fantasy basketball MCP (LobeHub listing) — referenced for basketball tool coverage.
- [stmorse's ESPN fantasy v3 API notes](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-v3.html) and the `ffscrapr` R package's endpoint vignette — view/endpoint documentation.
- `tlo1216/frontoffice-manager`'s `tools/` scripts (`snapshot-fetch.js`, `espn-cookie-fetch.mjs`, `diff-snapshot.mjs`, and the `espn-*-cheatsheet.md` files) — the source for the exact snapshot line format and the cheat-sheet facts this README and `src/espn/constants.ts` are cross-checked against.
- [MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) — `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, used directly.
